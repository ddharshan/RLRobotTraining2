## Description

This project is part of my MSc thesis research. I developed an OpenAI Gym–based simulation environment consisting of a robot, dynamic pedestrians, and a goal location. The objective of the robot is to reach the destination without colliding with pedestrians whose coordinates change over time. The model is trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Hybrid Proximal Policy Optimization (H-PPO) algorithm.

The repository RLAutonomousRobotNavigation2
(https://github.com/ddharshan/RLAutonomousRobotNavigation2)
contains the simulation environment, including the robot model, pedestrian models, and the goal representation.

The repository RLRobotTraining2
(https://github.com/ddharshan/RLRobotTraining2)
contains the Deep Neural Network architecture used to train the robot within this environment.

For a detailed explanation of the methodology and results, please refer to my thesis publication:
