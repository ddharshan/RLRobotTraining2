This project work is related to my MSc Thesis Research work.
Basically, I developed an OpenAI Gym based Robot and Pedestrian models, and the goal of the robot to reach the destination without colliding with pedestrians (Pedestrians' Co-ordinates are changing). 
The model trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning (H-PPO algorithm).
The Repository (RLAutonomousNavigation2 - https://github.com/ddharshan/RLAutonomousRobotNavigation2/tree/main) is an environment which includes the robot, goal spot and the pedestrians models.
The repository (RLRobotTraining2- https://github.com/ddharshan/RLRobotTraining2) includes the Deep Neural Network Design for the training of the robot in a such environment.
Pls read my work to get some idea about this repository project https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5178305
